Test Driven Environment is a software development process that emphasizes writing automated tests before writing the actual code. The process involves writing a test case that defines the desired behaviour of a piece of code, and then writing the code to pass that test case.

Test Driven Development usually follows the “Red-Green-Refactor” cycle:

Add a test to the test suite

(Red) Run all the tests to ensure the new test fails

(Green) Write just enough code to get that single test to pass

Run all tests

(Refactor) Improve the initial code while keeping the tests green

Repeat

The Test Driven Development process typically involves the following procedures:

Write a test case: The developer writes a test case that defines the desired behaviour of a piece of code snippet. This test case should be automated and should fail initially as the code to implement the desired behaviour has not yet been written.

Write the code: The developer writes the code to implement the desired behaviour, with the goal of passing the test case.

Run the Test: The developer runs the automated test case to verify that the code behaves as expected. If the test case passes, the developer can move on to the next test case. If the test case fails, the developer must modify the code to fix the issue and then re-run the test case.

Refactor the Code: Once the test case has passed, the developer can refactor the code to improve it’s design or performances, while ensuring that all test cases continue to pass.

WE have two approaches to Test Driven Development:

OUTSIDE IN:

INSIDE OUT: With the Inside Out (or the Detroit School of TDD or Classicist) approach, the focus is on the results (or state). Testing begins at the smallest unit level and the architecture emerges organically. This approach is generally easier to learn for beginners, attempts to minimize mocking, and helps prevent over-engineering. Design happens at the refactor stage, which can unfortunately result in large refactorings.

Benefit of Test Driven Development:

a) The Test Driven Development process is designed to ensure that codes is thoroughly tested.

b) That it meets the desired requirements before it is released.

c) Prevents bugs and costs.

d) Improve code structure.

e) By writing tests first, developers can ensure that the code is designed to meet the desired requirements, rather than simply implementing a solution and then testing it later.

CONCLUSION: Test Driven Development can also help to improve the quality of the code and reduce the number of bugs in the code, as developers are forced to think about edge cases and potential issues before writing the code. Adding to that, Test Driven Development can help to improve the collaboration between developers and testers, as automated tests can be used to verify that code changes do not break existing functionality.
